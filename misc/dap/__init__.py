"""dap: dynamic-algebra-potentials, executable core.

A Python implementation of the principal constructions of the paper
``dynamic-algebra-potentials.tex``: reactive vector spaces, smooth adaptive
arrangements, the smooth polynomial interpretation, and the two dynamics
functors ``Phiconf`` (configuration / descent) and ``Phiphase`` (phase / Hamilton)
of cor.functor, both built from a shared interpretation plus an integrator.
